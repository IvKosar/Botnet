Botnet has two parts: Server and Bot. The later is divided into CommunicationBot(talks to server) and AttackBot(talks to target).
Botnet assumes that Bot is infected into innocent binary file. So victim starts it by himself with no doubts.
Server is started by Master from gui or console interface.
However for now Botnet is divided into not connected parts. We are working on it =)

To run attackBot properly you must have Boost installed.
Compile it with cmake file CMAkeLists.txt in the project root and run ./botnet <ip-address> <port> <request> <# of requests>

Server and CommunicationBot are in process of development.
